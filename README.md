# pythonmachinelearning
As part of my learn python initiatve I am working through Sebastian Raschka book "Python Machine Learning"

<b>Raschka, Sebastian (2015-09-23). Python Machine Learning . Packt Publishing. </b>

This repo contains artifacts generated while reading Python Machine Learning. Most of the code is based on the coding examples presented in the book along with some refactors to convert the examples from a interactive mode focus to resuable modules. Also liberties have been taken to learn some of the constructs of python.

Alot of the code relies on: 
                    NumPy
                    SciPy
                    scikit-learn 
                    matplotlib 
                    pandas

(I have included a requirements.txt with the full list of dependencies)

## disclaimer
Feel free to clone, reuse in any manor, keeping in mind the intent of this code is to study Python from a ML perspective. no attempt to create production quality code has been taken. Also these are my early python days (I am primarily a java guy) and most importantly the work is heavily based on Sebastian Raschka's book.
