# pythonmachinelearning
As part of my learn python initiatve I am working through Sebastian Raschka book "Python Machine Learning"

##Raschka, Sebastian (2015-09-23). Python Machine Learning . Packt Publishing.

This repo contains artifacts generated from my reading PythonMachineLearning. Most of the code is based on the coding examples presented in the book with some refactors to convert the examples from a interactive mode focus to resuable modules. Also liberties have been taken to learn some of the constructs of python.

Alot of the code relies heavily on: 
                    NumPy
                    SciPy
                    scikit-learn 
                    matplotlib 
                    pandas

(I have included a requirements.txt with the full list of dependencies)

Feel free to clone, reuse in any manor, keeping in mind these are my early days in python (I am primarily a java guy) and the work is heavily based on Sebastian Raschka's book.
